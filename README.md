# Static Comp Project

##### Description

This project was geared to getting comfortable with using HTML and CSS and trying to create a webpage off of a static comp. We were given creative liberty over images, colors, and themes but needed to maintain the basic structure provided.

##### Usage

- Navigate to [Mike Flynn's Static Comp Challenge](https://mdflynn.github.io/mf-comp-challenge-1/)

- Open the developer tools and toggle the device toolbar.

- Choose different mobile types to see how the website interacts with each.

##### Timeline

Within 4 days, plan and create a responsive static comp to demonstrate the basics of HTML and CSS.

##### Resources

For this project, I used ATOM as my text editor and Github to manage my code and workflow. For the first time, I used Flexbox and learned about it through Flexbox Zombies on the web. I also used MDN and W3 Schools to do HTML and CSS research.

##### Challenges / Wins

Since this was my first time working with HTML and CSS, there were many challenges. Mainly getting flex to display and work in the way I intended it. This typically required to add more <div> so that I could have flex offer more control of the page setup.

The biggest win was just getting all of gaps cleaned up and finally having the media queries work!

##### Final Outcome

The website is responsive and works across mobile devices! The external links image changes when it goes from desktop to mobile to provide a better user experience across platforms.
